rbx-toolset
===========

This is a toolset for Robox 3d printer. Intention is for it to work on all platforms where Java and <a href="https://github.com/rxtx/rxtx">rxtx</a> library works.

All commands are executions of one Java jar file where first non option is a command name. It can be invoked like:

```
java -jar robox-toolset.jar {<general-options>} <command> {<specific-options>} [<sub-command>]
```

where elements enclosed in '{}' represent none or more occurences and '[]' none or one occurence of an element (EBNF syntax). Syntax is similar to 'git' command.

Until implemented as another command ('install' command) the easiest way of invoking toolset is to create /usr/bin/rbx shell script like:
```
#!/bin/bash

java -jar <path-to-jar>/robox-toolset.jar "$@"
```

for Unix bases machines or similar for Windows machines where .bat file should be in the PATH. Dont forget to set appropriate permissions (sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/rbx) to the script.

So, with rbx shell script, invocation of toolset commands should really look like this:
```
rbx {<general-options>} <command> {<specific-options>} [<sub-command>]
```
Example:
```
rbx status
```

General options for most commands are:

- -v or --verbose to increase verbosity of selected command
- -d or --debug to print debug information
- -p or --printer <printer-id> to select one printer this command is going to be applicable to

If there is only one printer attached to the computer then it will be automatically selected. If there is more than one printer attached then -p/--printer option must be selected. It is not applicable on commands that do not directly work with printer like 'list' or 'upload'. 

Also, many commands will accept:

- -h or --help command and display further options/sub-commands.

Here are currently provided commands:

Help
----

Lists commands available in the toolset.

List
----

This command lists currently attached printers. Usage:

```
rbx list
``` 

Status
------

Status command provides status of attached printer. Usage:
```
Usage: rbx [<general-options>] status [<specific-options>]

  General options are one of these:
  -v | --verbose   - increases voutput erbosity level
  -d | --debug     - increases debug level
  -p | --printer   - if more than one printer is connected to your
                     computer you must select which one command is
                     going to be applied on. You can get list of
                     available printers using 'list' command

  Specific options are:

  -h | --help | -?     - this page

  -h | --help | -?     - this page
  -a | --all           - displays all status information
  -s | --short         - displays values only
                         It is machine readable format.
  -e | --estimate      - displays estimate time until job completion.
                         See -f/--file option for more details.
  -j | --job           - displays job id
  -b | --busy          - displays busy flag
  -ps | --pause-status - displays pause status
  -cl | --current-line - displays current line number
  -tl | --total-lines  - displays total line number. Only if file was supplied.

For estimate to work, this utility needs original xxx_robox.gcode file.
See rbx upload command.

More time passed, estimate might be more correct. Estimate is calculated
by amount of lines processed per amount of time starting from when
<jobid>.estimate file is created.
```
Example:
```
rbx status -e
```

Upload
------

This command is to send xxxx_robox.gcode file to allow estimate to work. Also, same file is needed for estimate and work of 'web' command. Usage:

```
Usage: rbx [<general-options>] upload [<specific-options>]

  General options are one of these:
  -v | --verbose   - increases voutput erbosity level
  -d | --debug     - increases debug level

  Specific options are:

  -h | --help | -?     - this page

  -f | --file          - gcode file needed for estimate
  -i | --job-id        - job id
```

Note: if -f/--file option is not set, this command will try to
read job file from the stdin. But for it to work you must specify
-i/--job-id option with job-id. In case of -f/--file option you
may omit -i/--job-id option if file name comes form AutoMaker and
is in form xxxxxxxx_robox.gcode or xxxxxxxx.gcode where xxxxxxxx
is job id.

For estimate to work, this utility needs original xxx_robox.gcode file.
It will store file in ~/.robox/ dir, along with two more files:
  <jobid>.lines    - file that contains number of non-empty .gcode lines
  <jobid>.estimate - file with line number from job file that is higher
                     that 100 (warming bed and head). Also, that' file's
                     last modified date is going to serve for estimate
                     calculation.
You don't need to specify -f each time to obtain status - only once
at the beginning. <jobid>.estimate file is going to be create no matter
if estimate is going to succeed or fail (due to lack of <jobid> file
previously specified). It is going to be written only once per detected
job.

Also, the moment new job is detected, all other files from previous jobs
are going to be removed.

More time passed, estimate might be more correct. Estimate is calculated
by amount of lines processed per amount of time starting from when
<jobid>.estimate file is created.

Pause
-----
Pauses currently executing job. Usage:
```
Usage: rbx [<general-options>] pause [<specific-options>]

  General options are one of these:
  -v | --verbose   - increases voutput erbosity level
  -d | --debug     - increases debug level
  -p | --printer   - if more than one printer is connected to your
                     computer you must select which one command is
                     going to be applied on. You can get list of
                     available printers using 'list' command

  Specific options are:

  -h | --help | -?     - this page
```

Resume
------
Resumes paused job. Usage:
```
Usage: rbx [<general-options>] resume [<specific-options>]

  General options are one of these:
  -v | --verbose   - increases voutput erbosity level
  -d | --debug     - increases debug level
  -p | --printer   - if more than one printer is connected to your
                     computer you must select which one command is
                     going to be applied on. You can get list of
                     available printers using 'list' command

  Specific options are:

  -h | --help | -?     - this page
```

Abort
-----
Aborts current job. Usage:
```
Usage: rbx [<general-options>] abort [<specific-options>]

  General options are one of these:
  -v | --verbose   - increases voutput erbosity level
  -d | --debug     - increases debug level
  -p | --printer   - if more than one printer is connected to your
                     computer you must select which one command is
                     going to be applied on. You can get list of
                     available printers using 'list' command

  Specific options are:

  -h | --help | -?     - this page
```

Web
---
This command starts small web server and provides access to printers' status and ability to issue commands. Unlike 'abort', 'resume', 'pause' and 'status' commands this command do not accepts printer id and works with all printers attachet to the computer. Or none. It will discover printers attached after it has started. Also, will 'keep track' of disconnected and re-attached printers.

Usage:
```
Usage: rbx [<general-options>] web [<specific-options>] [<command>]

Example how to start server:
```
nohup rbx >web.log web --allow-commands &
```

Stopping server:
```
rbx web stop
```

Note: On Raspberry Pi, web command is going to automatically detect existence of /usr/bin/raspistill command and add it as if ```--image-command /usr/bin/raspistill``` was supplied to the command. In order to deliberately not use it you need to specify ```--image-command ""```.

GCode
-----

This command is sending gcode directly to the printer. Usage:

```

                     available printers using 'list' command

  Specific options are:

  -h | --help | -?     - this page
```
All arguments that do not start with '-' will be processed as gcode commands
and sent to the printer. Also, all sysin will be processed line by line and
sent to the printer. Resposes are prefixed with 'A' + number of argument + ': '
sent out or 'L' + number of line from sysin + ': ' (note trailing space).
